# Hack-N-Crash-Fake-System-Obliterator

💻 Hack ‘N’ Crash: Fake System Obliterator
This project is a lighthearted "Hacker Command Line Simulator" called Hack ‘N’ Crash. It creates the appearance of a hacking sequence in the terminal, followed by a dramatic "obliteration" of the system. Perfect for pranks or just having some fun with a classic "hacker movie" vibe!

⚠️ Note: This script does not perform any real hacking and is purely for visual entertainment. It doesn't affect your system or data in any way.

🎉 Features
Realistic "Hacker" Commands: Randomly generates hacker-style commands, simulating an "attack" on your system.
Destruction Mode: Ends the sequence with a fun "obliteration" effect, simulating system failure with over-the-top messages.
Typewriter Text Effect: Text appears character-by-character, adding to the suspense.
Zero System Impact: Completely safe and non-destructive – this is for entertainment only!
🛠 Requirements
Python 3.x: Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
▶️ Running the Simulation
Clone the repository or download HackNCrash.py.

Open a terminal, navigate to the directory where HackNCrash.py is located, and run the command python HackNCrash.py.

Sit back and enjoy the "hacking" visuals as your terminal becomes a scene out of a spy movie!

💻 Example Output
The script will start with "hacker" commands like these:

establishing connection to 127.0.0.1...
decrypting security key...
injecting payload...
downloading sensitive data...

It will end with dramatic messages like:

!!! INITIATING SELF-DESTRUCT SEQUENCE !!!
!!! FILESYSTEM CORRUPTION DETECTED !!!
!!! PURGING ALL LOG FILES !!!

🤫 Pro Tip: Prank Your Friends!
Want to have a little fun? Run this on a friend’s terminal (with permission!) and watch their reaction as the "system" seems to self-destruct!
